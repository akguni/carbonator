            <p>Efficiency of appliances and carbon footprint of electricity grids can vary significantly. 
                Therefore, if something does not make sense to you, please check the underlying assumptions and 
                try to find out the efficiency and costs applicable to your own situation.

                To get the most out of Carbonator users are encouraged to register and enter their own unit marginal cost of 
                electricity. It is usually straightforward find out the amount of CO₂ emissions per unit of electricity 
                with some search on your utility or government websites.

                It looks like there are many different assumptions on the capacity of trees to capture CO₂ emissions. 
                For Carbonator, the default value is taken from <a href=https://www.epa.gov/energy/greenhouse-gas-equivalencies-calculator>United States Environmental Protection Agency Greenhouse Gas Equivalencies Calculator</a>.
